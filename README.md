# Dark Pattern Buster Chrome Extension

## Overview
Welcome to the Dark Pattern Buster Chrome Extension developed by students from Sikkim Manipal University. Our extension is a powerful tool designed to detect and combat dark patterns on websites, providing users with a more transparent and user-friendly online experience. The project leverages three state-of-the-art language models: RoBERTa, XLNet, and BERT.

### Features
**Pattern Detection:** The extension utilizes three advanced LLM models—RoBERTa, XLNet, and BERT—to detect and highlight potential dark patterns on websites.

**Dataset:** We have gathered a comprehensive dataset from various sources to train and fine-tune our models for accurate pattern detection. The dataset has been taken from 

**User Alerts:** Receive real-time alerts when visiting a website that employs deceptive design practices.

**Educational Resources:** Access resources within the extension to learn more about dark patterns and how to protect yourself online.

### Examples of Dark Patterns
Here are some examples of dark patterns that the extension may identify on e-commerce platforms:

1. **False Scarcity:**
   - **Detection:** The extension can identify instances where an e-commerce site falsely claims limited stock to create a sense of urgency.
   - **Highlight:** The extension may highlight the false scarcity message or countdown timer.

2. **Hidden Costs:**
   - **Detection:** It can recognize situations where additional fees or charges are not transparently displayed during the checkout process.
   - **Highlight:** The extension may draw attention to hidden fees or costs before finalizing a purchase.

3. **Misleading Discounts:**
   - **Detection:** The extension can identify cases where discounts are falsely advertised, such as inflated original prices or misleading percentage-off claims.
   - **Highlight:** It may highlight the discounted price and provide information about the actual savings.

4. **Forced Continuity:**
   - **Detection:** Recognizing instances where users are automatically subscribed to recurring services or memberships without clear consent.
   - **Highlight:** The extension may alert users to the forced continuity practice and provide options to opt-out.

5. **Sneaky Opt-Outs:**
   - **Detection:** Identifying situations where users are manipulated into unknowingly opting into services or subscriptions.
   - **Highlight:** The extension may alert users to hidden opt-outs and guide them on how to opt-out if desired.
